# Unleash Yggdrasil JavaScript Engine

Unleash Yggdrasil Engine for JavaScript.

This is a JavaScript (or, more precisely, TypeScript) wrapper containing the core of the Unleash SDK domain logic, enabling you to develop your own Unleash JavaScript SDK.
If you're looking for the ready-to-use Unleash JavaScript SDK instead, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-client-node).
