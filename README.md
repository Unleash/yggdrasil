##### One SDK core connecting all the realms of Unleash.

Yggdrasil is a Rust project designed to create the core of the Unleash SDK domain logic in a single language (in this case Rust).

## Building the Core

Easy enough - run `cargo build --release` from the root of the project. You'll need an up to date set of Rust tools to do this.

To run the client specs, you'll first need to clone them:

`git clone --depth 5 --branch v5.0.2 https://github.com/Unleash/client-specification.git client-specification`

## Testing

This will run whole test suite

```
cargo test
```

## Node

The Node core is a special case, this doesn't use FFI like the other SDKs, instead this compiles the core down to WASM.

### Building

You'll need to build the core first, once that's compiled, from the root of the `node-sdk` project, run `wasm-pack build`. Once that's built, navigate to `{root}/node-sdk/pkg` and run `npm link`, which should make the node package available. Finally, from `{root}/node-sdk/www` run

```
npm link node-sdk
npm install
npm start
```

You can open a browser and head to `http://localhost:8080` and inspect the console to see the Unleash engine evaluate a toggle.

## Python

The Python core uses [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/v0.17.2/index.html) for its bindings.

### Building

Start by setting up and activating a virtual environment in the python-sdk folder:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) by executing `pip install maturin` in your shell. Then you can run `maturin develop`.
